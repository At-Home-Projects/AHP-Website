          <p>At Home Projects is a small group run primarily by High Schoolers and is for the creation and sharing of open-source projects such as school projects and other pieces of code that can easily be recreated at home! for example, the main subject of this group is, but not limited to, Arduino. We are open to other project types like Raspberry Pi, Microsoft Make Code, Roblox, websites, and anything else you can think of!
